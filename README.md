Re-live the antics of the original Magic 8 Ball, now ported to the HP-48G. Instead of a white plastic icosahedron (a polyhedron with 20 faces) die, floating in alcohol dyed dark blue, the calculator uses a pseudo-random number generator to determine which message to display on the LCD screen, following a short 3 second delay. In the past, the only way to ensure a random message would be to shake the ball first. With this version, that's no longer necessary.

To use, run the program, then think of a yes or no question you would like answered. Press the white menu button beneath Look, and wait for the 3 second countdown timer to complete before seeing the answer on the screen. The delay was added to simulate the time needed to turn the real Magic 8 Ball upside down and see the answer slowly revealed. At this point, the HP-48G will patiently wait for the next question to answer, triggered by another press of the Look button. To exit, press the white menu button under Quit. 

This version of the Magic 8 Ball uses the same collection of 20 responses as the original, broken down into 10 positive (afirmative), 5 neutral, and 5 negative answers to select from. You'll be sure to see the same familiar responses to those observed in the past. To add realism, the answers shown on screen are split across multiple lines between words in the same manner as the original.

| Positive | Positive | Neutral | Negative |
|---------|----------|---------|---------|
| It is certain. | As I see it, yes. | Reply hazy, try again. | Don't count on it. |
| It is decidedly so. | Most likely. | Ask again later. | My reply is no. |
| Without a doubt. | Outlook good. | Better not tell you now. | My sources say no. |
| Yes, definitely. | Yes. | Cannot predict now. | Outlook not so good. |
| You may rely on it. | Signs point to yes. | Concentrate and ask again. | Very doubtful. |
