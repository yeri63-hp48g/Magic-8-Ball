Re-live the antics of the original Magic 8 Ball, now ported to the HP-48G. Instead of a white plastic icosahedron (a polyhedron with 20 faces) dice, floating in alcohol dyed dark blue, the calculator uses a pseudo-random number generator to determine which message to display on the LCD screen, following a short 3 second delay. There's no possibility of getting bubbles in the liquid, making the message unreadable, so shake the HP-48G to your hearts content. Although, it will have absolutely no effect on the answers generated.

To use, run the program, then think of a yes/no question you would like answered. Press the white menu button under Look, and wait for the 3 second countdown timer to complete, added to simulate turning the real Magic 8 Ball upside down to reveal your answer following a short delay. The program will then wait indefinitely for the next question to answer, triggered by a keypress of the Look button. To exit, press the white menu button under Quit.
