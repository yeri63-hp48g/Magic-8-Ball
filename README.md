Re-live the antics of the original Magic 8 Ball, now ported to the HP-48G. Instead of a white plastic icosahedron (a polyhedron with 20 faces) dice, floating in alcohol dyed dark blue, the calculator uses a pseudo-random number generator to determine which message to display on the LCD screen, following a short 3 second delay. There's no possibility of getting bubbles in the liquid, making the message unreadable, so shake the HP-48G to your hearts content. Although, it will have absolutely no effect on the response shown.

To use, run the program Ball. Think of a yes/no question you would like answered, and then press the white menu button under Look. A 3 second countdown timer will be shown on the screen, followed by answer to your question. The program will pause indefinitely, waiting for the next question to answer, triggered by a keypress of the Look button. To exit, press the white menu button under Quit.
